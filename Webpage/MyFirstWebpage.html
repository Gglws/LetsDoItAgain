				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p>
					By the time the Chosen Undead encounters him, Artorias is shown to have already been corrupted by the Abyss with his armor looking putrefied, oozing an aura of darkness. 
					His crippled arm is likely the result of Artorias halting the spread from devouring his wolf companion by means of a now missing shield. 
					He possesses a greatsword that has also been consumed, yet is still far from ineffective. 
					Having lost his sanity, the knight moves about in an untamed, beastly manner as he howls beneath the blue shroud of his helm.

						Sir Artorias the Abysswalker was one of the Four Knights of Lord Gwyn.[1] He only makes an appearance in the past, as he is deceased by the time the Chosen Undead escapes the Undead Asylum.
						Knight Artorias wore distinctive armor, as well as the Wolf Ring, and brandished his Greatsword and Greatshield. He is known to have been a friend to Alvina of the Forest Hunter covenant. 
						Sif, the Great Grey Wolf was his companion, now guarding his grave and keeping the Covenant of Artorias ring in his possession.
						Artorias hunted the Darkwraiths[2] and was able to traverse the Abyss with the power of his ring, which he obtained after making a covenant with the beasts there,
						preventing him from being swallowed by the void, but cursing his sword in the process.[4] In recognition of his actions, he was awarded one of Anor Londo's treasures - 
						a Silver Pendant that allowed him to repel Dark sorceries.[5]
						When Oolacile became threatened by the Abyss created by Manus, Artorias and his wolf companion Sif arrived there in an attempt to save Oolacile and rescue the abducted Princess Dusk.[6] 
						However, the two were overwhelmed, and Artorias sacrificed himself to protect Sif using his Cleansing Greatshield, erecting a barrier around the young wolf.[7] 
						Swallowed by the Dark, he became corrupted along with his already-cursed sword.[8] He was then laid to rest by the Chosen Undead after their encounter in the coliseum of Oolacile.
						Once defeated, Hawkeye Gough mentions the player defeating Artorias, and speaks of him when talked to multiple times.[9]
						His legacy as a hero lasted for centuries. By the time of Lothric, there was the Undead Legion of Farron, who were commonly called the Abyss Watchers. They partook of wolf blood,[10] and it is said that their souls are bound together and are one with the soul of the "wolf blood master",
						11] who is Artorias.[12] Wielding greatswords modeled after his, and fighting in wild ferocious styles, the Legion fought a veritable war with the dark of the Abyss that their master had fought ages past.
						Since the souls of the Abyss Watchers effectively merged with Artorias prior to them Linking the Fire, this means via technicality that Artorias is a Lord of Cinder, despite him already being dead for (likely) thousands of years before the formation of the Abyss Watchers.
